# Online-Library-Management-System
The establishment of a library on Mars is a milestone in the cultural development of the planet.
However, due to the difficulties of transporting physical books to Mars, the creation of an Online
Library Management System became neccessary. 
The library needs a system for tracking the virtual books and
users so that new Martians can browse, check-in/out, and reserve books (the books will be
delivered electronically).
